# Orca Operator Guide

## Purpose

Orca is a local, multi-worktree execution harness for running autonomous coding agents in parallel. It manages session transport and observability while leaving task policy and judgment to agents.

Use Orca when you want to:

1. run multiple agents concurrently with isolated git worktrees
2. keep a durable run loop without manual re-launch for every issue
3. preserve strong observability via logs, summaries, and metrics

## Intent and Design Principles

1. Transport over cognition:
   - Orca scripts handle execution plumbing (`tmux`, loop lifecycle, artifact paths, lock primitives).
   - Agents handle decisions (issue selection, status transitions, merge/close strategy, discovery handling).
2. Explicit primitives over hidden heuristics:
   - Provide lock, summary, and logging primitives.
   - Avoid encoding behavioral policy in scripts.
3. Agent-owned lifecycle:
   - Agents claim work, update issue status, merge/push, and close issues.
4. Operational clarity:
   - Every run leaves traceable artifacts (`*.log`, `*-summary.json`, `metrics.jsonl`, discovery logs).

## When to Use Orca

Use Orca when:

1. the queue has multiple independent tasks
2. you want predictable per-run artifacts and postmortem visibility
3. a human operator is available to monitor and intervene on hard failures

Avoid Orca when:

1. tasks are highly coupled and require frequent manual pair-design
2. a single high-risk migration needs tightly controlled sequential execution

## Prerequisites

From repo root environment, ensure:

```bash
git --version
bd --version
tmux -V
jq --version
flock --version
docker --version
codex --version
```

Also ensure:

1. you are authenticated in agent tooling (`codex login` if needed)
2. repo has push access to `origin`
3. queue has actionable work (`bd ready`)
4. Dolt server mode is configured for beads (Orca start/stop manages the local container lifecycle)

## Core Workflow

### 1) Setup

```bash
./bb orca setup-worktrees 2
```

### 2) Start Loop Sessions

```bash
./bb orca start 2 --continuous
```

`orca start` now also starts (or creates) the local Dolt SQL server container (`bookbinder-dolt` by default) for beads server mode.

Bounded mode:

```bash
./bb orca start 2 --runs 5
```

### 3) Monitor

```bash
./bb orca status
ls -lt agent-logs
tail -n 10 agent-logs/metrics.jsonl
```

`orca status` includes a Dolt database section with mode, server config, container state, and `bd` connectivity check.

### 4) Stop

```bash
./bb orca stop
```

`orca stop` stops running Orca sessions and then stops the Dolt SQL server container.

## What the Loop Does vs What Agents Do

Orca loop (`agent-loop.sh`) does:

1. run one agent pass per iteration
2. provide prompt + run artifact paths
3. parse summary JSON and append metrics
4. continue until run limit or agent-requested stop

Agent does:

1. choose and claim issues
2. implement and validate
3. update issue states and notes
4. merge/push using `ORCA_WITH_LOCK_PATH` against `ORCA_PRIMARY_REPO`
5. close issues
6. record discoveries and summary JSON

Orca injects `ORCA_WITH_LOCK_PATH` and `ORCA_PRIMARY_REPO` into each run so merge scripts can use stable absolute paths and avoid worktree-relative path mistakes.

## Operating Playbook

### Daily Start

```bash
git pull --rebase
bd sync
./bb orca start 2 --continuous
./bb orca status
```

### Live Checks

```bash
bd ready --limit 20
bd list --status in_progress --limit 50
bd list --status closed --sort closed --reverse --limit 20
```

Dependency-merge guard for a candidate issue:

```bash
scripts/orca/check-closed-deps-merged.sh <issue-id>
```

If this guard fails, closed blocking dependencies are not yet represented on `main`; treat the issue as not executable in the current run.

Attach to a session:

```bash
tmux attach -t bb-agent-1
# detach: Ctrl+b then d
```

### Scale Up / Down

Scale up:

```bash
./bb orca start 3 --continuous
```

Scale down cleanly:

```bash
./bb orca stop
./bb orca start 2 --continuous
```

## Failure Handling

1. Agent requests stop (`loop_action=stop`):
   - expected for no-work or explicit shutdown conditions
   - inspect latest `*-summary.json` / `*-summary.md`, then restart if needed
2. Agent claim races:
   - normal in parallel operation; agent should select another issue
3. Merge/push failures:
   - agent-owned; inspect logs and issue notes, then restart sessions as needed
   - ensure lock-guarded merge scripts use `set -euo pipefail` so early command failures cannot be masked
   - require a pre-merge cleanliness check on `ORCA_PRIMARY_REPO` (`git diff --quiet` and `git diff --cached --quiet`) so dirty `main` fails before fetch/merge
4. Immediate agent command failures:
   - verify CLI auth/config and `AGENT_COMMAND`

## Safety Rules

1. avoid destructive git commands during active swarm sessions
2. avoid manually editing multiple agent worktrees at once unless deliberate
3. keep beads as source of truth for queue state and dependencies
4. keep shared-target writes inside `ORCA_WITH_LOCK_PATH` lock-guarded commands

## Operator Checklist

Before ending a session:

1. active failures are understood and noted
2. blockers are reflected in issue notes
3. important follow-up work is represented in beads
4. local repo state is synchronized and pushed per `AGENTS.md`
